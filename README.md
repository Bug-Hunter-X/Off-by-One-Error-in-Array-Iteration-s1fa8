# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The solution provides the correct loop condition to avoid this issue.
